Plants vs. Zombies terminal simulation Developed a text-based simulation of the "Plants vs. Zombies" game with a command-line interface (CLI). The project implements a grid-based board where players manage resources and place units to defend against waves of enemies, demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

This project was developed in collaboration with Daniel Roldan Serrano (https://github.com/danirold)
